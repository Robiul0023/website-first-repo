				<h2>Definition of mission</h2>
				<p>A mission statement outlines 
				a startup’s underlying motivation for being in business. 
				It spells out the contribution to society that 
				the organization aspires to make. 
				The mission statement is not a strategic objective, 
				but rather the basis on 
				which the strategic objectives and strategic
				plan are developed. 
				This ensures that the startup’s goals derive
				from the basis
				on which the company was founded.

				Not everyone agrees with the value of a mission statement. 
				And many companies do well enough without one. 
				We believe that creating a mission statement is important 
				for startups.
				A well-formulated mission statement can form the nucleus of 
				the startup by identifying what unites the stakeholders 
				(customers, shareholders and employees</p>

					 <h2>Realization Make New Idea For Covering Failure</h2>
						<p>As   a  human  being  in   the  world  we   
						have  to face  different  kinds  of  barrier  
						on  the  way  of  success. 
						It  is  accurate  that  these  types  of barricade 
						make  new feelings  and  realization  in  our mind.  
						As   a  result  we  seek  new  way  to  change our
						current  situation. 
						It  is  true  that whenever we try to change our
						current situation, 
						we  have  to face different kinds of adversities,
						including financial, social. 
						And  we have to face the adversity caused by more 
						different types of  situation</p>
						<blockquote>
						These  blockade in  most  of the time  not only 
						comes  from other  environment  but  also 
						sometimes  family.  
						Moreover, inspite of   different  bunker  on  
						the  way  of  achieving  goal  some people  
						overcome  these  obstacles.  
						but  most  of  the people   in our  society  can 
						not  conquer  it . 
						There   are  many  reasons  behind  the   matter .
						First   is  that, lack  of  proper  plan. 
						In addition  insufficient  hard work for the 
						success. 
						Moreover, incapability  of  discover reasons  for
						failure of  the  work. 
						On  the  other hand ,  veritable realization  of
						failure </blockquote>
						<p>In addition,  it  is  sure that  realization
						helps us  to  make  new  idea   for   achieving
						success.  
						Furthermore,  If  we  exactly  implementation  of
						idea  with  hard work,   
						then  we  achieve  success  in easy  way.  
						Moreover,  we  everybody  known  that  the  way
						of  success  is not  bed  of roses . 
						Likewise, we  must  hard working  with confident
						and continuously on  the  based of  specific 
						well  plan   for achieving success . 
						Besides,  it  is  true  that  if  we   always
						cherish  the  realization  that,   success  is 
						for us,  and  that it is possible  to  achieve
						it   in  our Pahma. 
						And  we  believe in this realization  if  we  
						work according to  a  specific plan. Then no 
						obstacle in the  world can move us away  from
						achieving success.  
						Moreover,  as a  result,  it will be   stimulate
						us   pscychologically.  
						In addition,   end of the day   we   also 
						achieve desirable success.</p>
						<h2>Now  The  Potential  Question  is  That
						What  do  We  Mean  by  Realization?</h2>
						<p>There are  diffrent  opinion about  
						realization, In contrast, it  is  absolutely
						sure  that,  perception is  about  getting rid
						of  past  failures, 
						wrongdoings,  cultivating a good mindset,
						decision making and determination to work in 
						a  new  way and  work accordingly.</p>

							<h2>Do Not Compromise With Your Dreams</h2>
							<p>If  you   get  proper   respect  from your 
							family  and  your  society  then  you  have  
							be  successful  in  right  place  and  also 
							in proper  position . 
							In contrast,  if  you  be  a  successful  
							you have  to maintain  strictly  some condition.
							First of all,   you must  make   a  better
							beautiful  dream or goal,
							Next, you  must  believe  that  you are 
							the perfect person  for  achieving  the 
							dream that  means  you have to   keep   full
							confidence  to  achieve  your  objective. 
							In  addition, you  must  build  accurate  
							design   for  touching  the  goal.  But  
							it  is  absolutely  true  that any  success
							in our  life  do not  get  in easy way. 
							So  we  have  to believe  strongly   that 
							the path  of  success  is  always  very  
							rough and tough. Success  come  in our  
							life in   return  of  better  well plan,  
							hardworking, cost of  many time, physical 
							and mental both energy and also continuous 
							process  of practice  and practice and 
							also  patience. waiting  for success.  
							Then  you  will   get  success  or   
							win the  dream.  Otherwise  you  will 
							fail.Moreover  it  is  certainly  true 
							that    success always  brings by default   
							some  happiness  element. For  instance: 
							money, 
							honor  love  and  different  type  of 
							wealth. Hence,  No  compromise  with 
							dreams in exchange of  something .</p>
							<h3>That  is  The Important    
							Difference   Between Successful  and 
							Unsuccessful  People 
							in  The  Case  of  Respect  and  
							Inspire  Other.</h3>
							<p>In  another  words , it  is  sure 
							that  those  who  are  defeated or  
							less  successful  in  the  battle of 
							life.
							Actually, they  never  have  the 
							courage to  influence  others  on  the 
							path  to  positive  success. 
							Because  human  instincts  are  the  
							work  of  successful  people  and 
							their  success stories not  only 
							attract  people. 
							But  also  inspire  them   to  succeed.
							In addition,  we  will  see  if  we 
							explain  this  issue  in  a  different
							way. 
							Then  a  person  sacrifices  a   lot 
							to  succeed  in  a  positive  way.  
							Such  as:  physical  and  mental  
							labor,  time,  in  addition  to  many 
							times  they suppress   the  mind , 
							give  up  a  lot  of  happiness  and 
							joy. Besides,  they  go  to  work only
							for  great  success. 
						    Then  success  comes  in  their  life.</p>
							<p>In  contrast,  those  who  fail  to 
							realize   the  importance  of  these  
							deeply  and  
							surrender  to  the  desire  of  the 
							mind by  emphasizing  temporary 
							happiness   and  joy. 
							As  well  as, for  these  reasons,
							they  are  deprived  of  great   
							success in  life.  
						    And  great  happiness  and  joy  
							in long run  and  carry  the  shame 
							of   failure.</p>

							<h2>Hesitation Creates Obstacles, Take
							Any Opportunity With Your Courage</h2>
							<p>Opportunity  come  our  life.  But 
							some people  can  not   catch  it. 
							Because they feel hesitation  to 
							make  decision. 
							In addition,  it is sure that,  in
							most of  the time those who  feel  hesitate
							to  take decision. Similarly, they lose
							great opportunity. 
							And  then,  it  is  not only  true  for 
							individual life  but  also  nationally.</p>
								<h2>Negative  Impact   of  Hesitation</h2>
									<blockquote>
										In addition,  it is  obviously
										accurate  that, most of  the 
										people is  lose  their  many
										opportunity only  for their 
										hesitation. 
										So,  do  not  be hesitate for 
										taking better opportunity.

										Besides,  it is  undoubtedly 
										true  that who  have  felt 
										hesitation  they  have  lost 
										many opportunity  in their life. 
										But some time hesitation is 
										good for human being. And  then,
										when  hesitation  make blockade 
										on the wrong way.  
										But  those who are alwayse 
										hesitant  to make   decisions 
										are  really  concerned   about 
										their  present and  future.   
										And,  despite all  these people  
										being hardworking   and  talented. 
										Yet on the battlefield  of  life 
										they lag far behind the less talented 
										people
									</blockquote>
									<p>Most importantly ,  the  truth  is 
									that  successful  people take  failure
									as  an  opportunity .  
				And  in  that light  they  look  for   new  ways  to  
				succeed  and  they  never  give  up.

				The  Chinese philosopher Confucius,  mentioned in  this 
				verse,  
				says  that  the  seeds of   success are  hidden   in  
				the midst  of  failure.

				Because  successful  people   are  always  optimistic
				and   confident.  Likewise,  
				just  as  optimistic    and  self-confident   people 
				have  snatched  success  by  overcoming failure  over
				the  ages.  
				So,  they  have  been  able to  gain respect  and  love
				from  others.</p>
				
				<p>Also,  one  of  the  great  truths  about   the  
				world from  its  
				birth  to  the  present  day is  that  only  successful
				people   can  easily  
				inspire hope and  inspire  hope  in  people who  are
				left  behind   in  the  battle   of  life or  in 
				despair.</p>
