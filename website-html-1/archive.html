 <h2>Definition of 'Archive'</h2>
 <img src="images/archive-sucess.jpg" alt="archieve images" />
 
  <p>The word ‘archive’ is hard to define, as it is used in various ways, 
  depending on context. It can mean:

    A collection of items which form evidence of the 
	activities of a person or institution.

    A building where historical records are kept – also called
	‘archive centres’, 
	‘record offices’ or ‘repositories’.

    Any papers that are old or used infrequently.

    The act of adding records to an archive.

	Throughout this website, we shall consider the word 
	‘archive’ to mean:
	A collection of documents created or gathered by one
	person or institution and selected for long-term preservation
	as evidence of their activities.</p>
	<p>The format of these documents does not matter; 
	they can be medieval parchment documents, maps, photographs 
	or even digital files.
	They can be centuries old or just weeks old.

	Archival documents are primary sources, 
	having been created at the time of the events 
	they describe by participants or witnesses of those events. 
	They are usually unique.

	Individual archival documents are often referred to as 
	‘records’ because they record an event.
	They can also be called ‘manuscripts’, although
	this relates to the fact that they were created
	by hand rather than being published.

	We’d advise against using the word ‘archive’
	in the senses of c) and d) above, as these can be 
	ambiguous and don’t reflect the true nature of archives 
	as documents that are felt to be historically significant, 
	now or in the future.

	Remember that the kind of archives we are concerned with
	have the following qualities:</p>

	 <h3>Natural spots</h3>
	 <p>Traveling is  the best way  for   gaining  practical 
	 knowledge   about 
	 the  place  and  environment. In  this   case  there is no 
	 alternative. 
	 In addition, it is  absolutely  accurate that,  many people  
	 everyday travel
	 in different  place  only for their professional work.</p>
	 <p>On  the  contrary,  When  you  take  a   trip   in excursive 
	 place for 
	 mental  recreation.  For  instance: sea beach, river bank,  
	 awesome  forest,
	 shower. Then it  keep  you in relax,   removing mental  stress  
	 and   boost 
	 energy  in your  body  and  mind.  As  a   result,   at  the end 
	 of  the 
	 tour.  It  seems  as  if  such  a  colorful  time   could  have  
	 been  spent  for  a  few  more  days .  You  feel  more  like. 
	 It  is  not  just  travel,  it  is  the nectar  of  being good 
	 in  body  and mind.</p>
	 <p>In  addition,  if  we  immerse ourselves in our daily activities
	 with the  feeling of  happiness.  Then  we  will be free  from 
	 the  worries, frustrations, excessive  stress.
     Furthermore, so each of us should do all the work . 
	Including  professional  responsibilities with joy  and  good home 
	to keep  ourselves  free  from stress. Finding joy in the middle 
	of work.  Love the work without feeling  the  burden.  
	Taking work as  an addiction. Not  a  profession is beneficial 
	in 
	all  respects. As  a  result,  we will be free from  a  lot of 
	stress.</p>
