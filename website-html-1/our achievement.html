				<h2>Achievement for our Organization</h2>
				<p>It's important to develop achievement levels in your organization to give the employees goals to which they can ascribe. A goal is a benchmark in the future and provides a level of motivation and recognition for exceptional work. Achievement levels provide measurable landmarks of your progress through the organization</p>
				
				<p>Many companies use titles to designate achievement levels in their organizations. Often with the titles comes additional responsibility. At other times, the title signifies a raise in pay or recognition of time spent in the company. Senior sales associate and assistant manager often are titles that carry little extra duties but recognize an employee's level of service. Senior vice president, partner and managing director are titles to which employees can aspire that usually come with new job descriptions and substantially more responsibilities and pay.</p>

					<h3>Be serious for success</h3>

					<p>In the earth we learn many things for our earn and also lead better life. But in first time we can not assimilate every things. Every topic we can assimilate by more and more practice. Without practice assimilate of any subject is quite impossible. For this reason who are expert they say that practice makes a man perfect. More practice help you to be more perfect in specific work or subject. When you will be more expert by your more practice then you will achieve more value to your client or any specific valuable situation.</p>
					<p>Secondly,  it is certainly true that, we acknowledge, and do not. The ultimate  truth   is that without  dreams  the progress of race and individual  is  not possible.  If  there is only a  dream.</p>

				<div id="achievement_first">
					<h3>Attentive for lesson</h3>

					<p>Dream is soul for  better life. It is called stamina. Moreover, without dreams  your life is lazy life. Where there is no dream, it is certain that there is no liveliness  of life. In addition, dream always determine what is your life destination and what do you want? Who are optimistic and wise they always  give importance  dream. Besides, they  make better plan on the basis of best dreams.  The matter of dream is not related to individual  but also  nation.  Furthermore,  it is true that  ther are dream a  person and a  nation. But every dream is  most important for development of individual  life and  national life.So,  we  can  say for  sure   that   the pace  of  progress   of  human life depends  on the combination of  real  action  with dreams.</p>

					<h3>Be smart for your work</h3>

					<p>Furthermore, it  is undoubtedly true  that life is not bed of  roses.  But everybody   like   to reach  dreams. Similarly,  the way  of  touch   dreams  is  never smooth. Besides,  unpleasant but surprising  things are not as  easy   as  winning dreams. Word of mouth or dreaming.  It  is  the combination of  a  man  or  a  nation with a  lot  of  labor. Time  and  sacrifice   to  achieve   small  goals and  a  combination of  realistic  work.   So  that  goal  can be   achieved   by easily.  Overcoming the  obstacles  in the way  of  attaining  target.

					In fact, in order to  achieve  big  object.  A person  or  a  nation  has to  gain confidence and  experience  through  acquiring  small  destination.  Then it becomes  easy to achieve great knowledge. </p>

					<h3>Be honest and practical</h3>

					<p>And then, mankind has been trying to overcome. All  obstacles for the sake of  happiness, bliss  and  humility  since  its  creation. Some succeed  in overcoming obstacles. While  others fall  behind  due  to  wrong  planning,  laziness,  failure  to make   the right  decision at  the right time.

					Again, many  people give up  because they  are  afraid  of  obstacles in the way of  attaining  goals. In  this  way in the battle  of  attaining the  ultimate success,  happiness, prosperity, honor and humility of life. One wins and is awarded  the status  of  a  hero. Another  fails and  another escapes from life like  a  coward.  Because life is burden to them. Likewise, the person or nation that combines  the action  well with  the dream  will  reach  the peak of  rapid  progress.</p>

						<p>Again,  there are some obstacles  in the  way  of  true life.   Over  which man has no real control.  For instance: when a medical student left home  to attend the final examination  of  becoming a  doctor.  When he left for the examination center, he was found dead in a  road accident. Jusr five minutes   before the  examination center.</p>

						<p>What  do  we  call  this  kind  of obstacle?  Or  a  person dies of  a  heart attack  the moment  he  is  elected  president  by popular  vote. But even then people cannot  be stopped  in the battle  of life. Because man  is the best creature  of  creation.  People do not  have to work for their own good  just  so  save themeselves . Man must work for himself   and  for the neglected   and deprieved  people around him. And  even extend  his helping hand  to other creatures of  creation.</p>
