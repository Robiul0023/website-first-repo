							, meditation and

							eating natural  
							or  oganic food   for  a  long  
							healthy life  along  with  regular  exercise 
							and  meditation

							physically and  mentally  healthy,  relaxed  
							and  free  from  
							various  kinds  of  stress.</p>

							problem of human being. 
							Specifically who are doing job or business

							organization in different position.  
							They feel it very highly.  
							Moreover, In  that case  it creates different 
							types 
							of disturbance in human society.  
							In addition,  It influence our social and family 
							life in various  way .

							So, Now  The  Effective  Way   to Solve  The 
							Problem  is

							We have to be more creative so that we can 
							avoid all types of mental tension. 
							On the contrary,  spiritually  if  we 
							practice  some rules and  work.    
							Then  we can  get easily  relief  from everyday 
							different  type  
							of   mental  pressure   and   physical  pain.  
							For  example:  regular physical exercise 
							meditation , 
							Yoga   and   express deeply  grateful feelings 
							to  our  Great  
							creator  Allah/ Creator.
							Furthermore,   if  we    believe  in  our 
							religion.

							and whole  
							universe  are  created  by  Great creator / Allah. 
							So , feel  thankful  from the  bottom of   your
							heart to 
							the  great  Creator  of  all  blessing that

							believe  that when the servant   expresses  
							gratitude to  the Creator after  enjoying  
							the  blessing given  by  the Creator.

							life  in the earth.</p>

						   <h2>What is Feeling?</h2>
						   <img src="images/feelings-1.jpg"/>
							<p>Feeling   is  a  such  a  process of  action  
							of  the mind  which  is  influence  us  physically
							and mentally.  
							But  it  is  expressed through the emotion and
							various types of  behavior   reaction in different
							time dissimilar  environment  of mind stage

							To more  illustrate:

							In addition,  
							it is  sure that we  can  distinguish our 
							different  types  of  emotional  and  behavioral  
							activities in various kinds  of environment  
							only through    feelings.

							So  that  we  can understand   what    is  
							painful  and enjoyment matter for us.  
							Which   things  should  avoid    and  accept 
							us .

							Besides,  such as:   when we  take  food 
							and drink water 
							we  can  recognize  the taste  of  food and 
							water. 
							And then we  can  determine  which food  is  
							delicious and  bitter for us.

							Moreover, when someone physically   attack 
							us at that  time  we  can understand  that 
							we  have to protect  it.
							Because our mind  send  us reaction that  we 
							must  save us from the hit.

							Furthermore, while  we  lose our favorite 
							things and  person then we realize torment 
							in our mind. This mind reply  is  called  
							feeling.

							Likewise, in that case  it  is easy to say 
							that  after  reaction of  every  action in  
							any act mentally  and physically  is   called 
							feeling.</p>
							<h4>And,  Now  The  Question is  That  How  
							to  Understand  Feelings?</h4>
							<p>This  answer,   in one sentence, we can 
							realize  it through the  five senses  in our
							body.</p>
							<p>This  five organ of human body  is  
							touchable and  it is  called    source of  
							feelings  and  knowledge. 
							On the other hand there  are  one more sense
							is called  sixth  sense of human life. 
							It  is untouchable  but believe it  on the
							basis of  mind power. 
							Such as: imagination power, Capability of 
							forecasts about future ,  
							communication  with other  through  
							the subconscious mind  that is  known as  
							telepathic.</p>
							<h3>Classification  of  Feelings  on The 
							Basis  of  Five Senses</h3>
							<h4>1. Feeling  of Sight</h4>
							<p>Utilization   of  eyes is only  for watching 
							scenery of  environment,
							incident  and any things. When we  watch 
							a  place, incident  and  accident or other
							things  
							at  that time  we  can realize  about the 
							things.
							For  example: if  we  see  any accidental
							death it creates  pathetic   response  in
							our body. 
							Then,  it follows that  we  go  ahead  to 
							help the   affected people.  
							In contrary,  while  we   see   rainbow, 
							or beautiful drama,  beautiful  opposition
							gender, 
							awesome  nature,  highly romantic  scenery
							etc. 
							
							Then, it  creates in our mind  lovable  
							feedback . This response  or feedback   
							is  made  
							through watching  the environment  through
							the eyes.  
							Furthermore, for this reasons it is called 
							feeling of sight.</p>
							<h4>2. Affection of Hearing</h4>
							<p>  Ears  are  used  for  hearing  sound
							of  object  and  voice of man. 
							It  helps  us  to  gain knowledge   about 
							the object  and  man. 
							For  instance:  when we  hear  sound  of 
							a bomb explosion  at once  
							it make  negative answer  about  the environment
							in our mind.   
							Then ,  as a result  we  take more  careful 
							step  about 
							the place and   try  to  stay in  safe mode . 
							Alternatively,  when hear  a 
							interesting voice song  at that time   it  
							creates  enjoyment  rejoinder  in our mind.  
							Likewise, thereby  we  take more   attentiveness 
							to enjoy   the  song  properly.</p>
							<h4>3. Feeling  of  Taste</h4>
							<p>We  use  tongue  only   for  taking 
							taste of food  and  water. One example 
							is that  after  eating  palatable food
							it  build   desire to more food  in our mind.

					 However, when get  bitter taste  in any food 
					 or water then it creates  negative response in
					 our mental   to give up the food or  water.

					 And then, in that case it  is obviously truth 
					 that   in here the mind reflection about  the
					 food. Just as:  “desire to more food” about  
					 delicious food.

					 Next is that, “to give up the food ” about 
					 the bitter taste food.

					  So,  now  we  can  say  both  reflection  
					  of  our mind about food  is  called  feeling 
					  of  taste.

					  Moreover, it is certainly  truth that  as  a
					  human being  we everybody  like to  stay with 
					  better things, no bad.</p>
							
					  <h4>4.The Sense  of  Smell</h4>
					  <p>Taking   smell  of  food,  object   and 
					  breathing in the  air  through    the  nose.
					  To  illustrate :</p>
					  <p>When  we  take  smell  of   food or  object 
					  at  that  time   we  perceive   condition   
					  about  food, object  and  air. 
					  In addition, it  is  obviously true that   
					  if  smell   is  healthy for us   then  we 
					  wish  try  to  take  more .

					  Furthermore,  now  we can realize that  in 
					  this  sentence  the  word  “wish”  it   means 
					  feeling  and  we  know that  feeling  is  a 
					  process  of  action of our mind. 
					  Besides,  it  is  certainly  true that in   
					  this  sentence the word ” wish”  is used in 
					  positive  sense of the  action.

					 In contrast,  whenever  the smell  of  object  
					 or air  is  filthy  at that moment  it  creates
					 negative impression in our mind  so that  
					 we  want to try   as  far  as quickly  to  leave
					 the  place  as  if  we  can feel  more  better 
					 and  keep  well  physically  and  mentally.
					 In  here  the word  of  “want to leave”  means 
					 that  feeling. Although, these  words  are  
					 utilized in  this sentence in negative sense 
					 of  feeling.

					  Moreover, in conclusion  it  is sure that 
					  positive  and  negative  both smell reactions 
					  are  part  of  feeling.</p>
				      <h4>5. Feeling  of   Touch</h4>
					  <p>Whichever  we  touch  any things  in the  
					  earth we have to do it through  our  skin. 
					  Moreover, we everybody known   universally  that 
					  our whole body is covered and protected   by corium.  
					  Similarly, for this  reasons we  can not imagine
					  without  dermis  our  existence. 
					  Besides, in that  case,  whenever we  hold  any 
					  object  for  example: man,  
					  food, book etc  in the earth   at once  we  can
					  understand  position of  the object.

					   For  instance :  when our  any organ  comes in
					   touch of fire  at  once  we  get  negative reply 
					   from our mind  so that  we  move  from fire. 
					   In addition,  in  this  sentence the  word of 
					   “reply”  means  feeling  that  is process  of 
					   action of the mind.

					   Alternatively,  if  we touch  our lover  or  
					   desirable  person  at  that  moment  we  can  
					   grasp  that like  to touch the person  more long time.

					   Furthermore,  in this  sentence the word 
					   grasp means  feeling  and  it  is  used 
					   here  as  a positive  response  of  the  mind.</p>
					  <h4>Expression of Feelings</h4>
					  <h4>For example:</h4>
					  <p>It  is  universally  truth  that  expression
					  of  feelings is  the most  potential  matter 
					  for  all. 
					   Moreover,  it is obviously  sure  that   
					   we  can  realize   about  other person  motive  
					   through  only  expression of feelings.</p>
					   <h3>But,  now  question  is  that  in which 
					   part  of  our body   keep  most  important 
					   role  in the   expression  of  feelings?</h3>
					   <p>In  one  sentence   the  query  answer  
					   is  that  mouth  area .

						Because  in our life every  happiness  incident
						or  accident  our  every  expression is  
						expressed initially  through  our  face.  
						Due   to which everyone  says  that face  is 
						the  mirror  of  the heart.

						For  instance: when  someone  is  in  trouble
						, his  face becomes  pale.

						Smile  is  the inevitable  part  of  facial 
						expressions  of  feelings.

						For  example: when  a  man  gets  his  desired
						promotion,  a  smile  appears  on  his  face.

						 Again, when someone makes fun of  someone,  
						 they express  it through laughter. 
						 In addition,  another  important matter is  
						 that,  in most time,  sweet  smile  is one of  
						 the  best tool  for  making  better relation 
						 with clients   and   other.</p>
						<p>Unnecessary  laughter, on the  other hand, 
						destroys  a  person’s  personality.

						 So,  we  have  to   express  laughter according
						 to our  environment  and  situation, and  if 
						 we  accept  this issue in a  good  way,  
						 we will   accept it  with respect and  dignity.
						 Otherwise,  it  will not  be  good for us.

						 Furthermore, it is  accurate that depending
						 on the expresion of   feelings,  a person’s
						 personality determined by  others.

						 Likewise,  it  is  sure  that, personality  
						 is  the  most  important  factor  for  a

						<p>We  everybody   believe  that    mind

						They  will  want  to  stop you .  
						In contrast,  I , We  and  You  do  not 
						be  fear  on  face   any   enemy  and   
						problem .</p>
					   <p>More over, it is obviously accurate that, 
					   life in the earth for the forthright person,
					   Who are cowards the lose a lot of great 
					   opportunity benefits. 
						As a result they often fall behind in the

						<p>Furthermore,   if  we    believe  in  our 
						religion.  
						Then  we  have  to believe that we  and  earth
						and whole  universe  are  created  by  
						Great creator / Allah. </p>
						<p>Moreover, theoretical  is  not  less  importance 
						matter.  Some importance  sector  it   is

	<h2>Gain Experience in Everyday It is One of The Most 
	Important Key for Success.</h2>
   <img src="images/img-9.jpg"/>
	<p>Life is  matured  by  experience.  Moreover, it  is  
	obviously  verifiable that cxperience  is  one  of  the  
	most important key of  success.</p>
	<blockquote>Furthermore,  it is  plainly truth that most
	of  the antagonistic   situation.  We  can  over come  
	successfully only  by  our   experience.  Besides,  if  
	we  observe  properly  around  us  then we will  watch 
	that many people. Who  have  vast  experience in  specific
	work  or  subject,  they can   overcome not  only  all type 
	of obstacle but also   easily  achieve  their desirable  
	success in their life. In addition,  if we  analyze  behind  
	the cause  of their  present  success  then  we  get  more 
	story  of  work for achieving success. For example: long
	term plan wise    work ,   using better  technique  for  
	getting  more  feedback.  well plan basis  hardwork, 
	rutin wise practise  for succee. Taking  cooperation 
	from  experienced person.</blockquote>
	<p>It  is certainly  correct  that  success  is  not easy
	for all. In contrast, it is  also true that success is not
	impossible matter at all . Who work for gaining success with
	well plan basis  and also apply  previous  experience. 
	Then  they also abtain   victory in their work.
	<h2>Now  The  Query  is  That  What  is  Experience?</h2>
	<p>Although  the  quiz  is  practical work related  even
	then in once  sentence  we  can  get    the question 
	reply is that</p>
	<blockquote>Experience  is   the   capability of  
	after
	learning practically  doing  work  according to 
	professional
	standards ,
	leading the  work of others  to  discover problem  and 
	proper solution  of  the specific work.
	For example:  if  you learn driving course then you get
	instruction from your instructor during the course. 
	In contrast,  after  completion your course  when you 
	drive the car on the street according to  professional  
	standards ,  
	lead other to drive   as  a  instructor, troubleshoot  
	of  complication and also blend  that is  called  your 
	experience
	</blockquote>
	<p>Besides,  it  is  certainly  true  that experience 
	is  always related  to knowledge. And  then,  it  is  
	sure  that  acquire  more  knowledge in specific  subject
	means  that  more  experience.
	On  the  other hand,  no  knowledge means  that  no  
	experience.
	Likewise,  it  is  universally  ensure  that  attain more 
\	conscious  it  increases   more value  to your  client  
and  also  in workplace.</p>
   <h2>Furthermore,  It  is  More  Potential Question is That  
   How  to  Get  Experience</h2>
   <p>For  acquiring  experience  initial  condition is  that 
   your self determination  and    realization  to  know  
   importance  of  experience. Because,  we everyone  strongly
   believe  that  there  is  a   way  if  there  is  a  will</p>
   <p>However, in the modern world  generally  in  two  way  we 
   can   achieve  incident  in  any  specific  work.</p>
   <p>  Just  as:  1. Physically

				   2.  virtually

				   To  illustrate:
  1. Physically  means  that  you  have  to    be  attend  
  biologically   in
  targeted   
  organization or  institution  to  obtain practical  
  knowledge  in specific 
  subject  according to   their  convenient   schedule.
  Such  as :  factory  worker,  restaurant  waiter,  
  construction  labor  etc.
  2.  On  the  other hand  in the acquisition of  knowledge  
  using virtual 
  system.  For  example:  through  internet . practical  
  appearance is 
  not all time  important  factor  but  your  response  in 
  the work is  the  most  dynamic   question. In addition , 
  in  virtual   system we  can communicate  easily  with other.
  In particular:  through facebook, you tube,  messenger, whats
  app, imo, google, instagram and  other  social media.
  Though,  in most  cases  practical  event  always  get  first 
  preference.</p>

	     <h2>Time is The Main Factor to Get Answers are 
		 Available in Time</h2>
		 <img src="images/img-10.jpg" alt="time is most important factor"/>
		 <p>Time  is  the  is the  most  important  factor in our life.
		 In another words, we  like  to  get  every incident  questions
		 all  answers   in timely. 						<p>In addition, 
		 it is a  fact that human life is  very diverse and some 
		 people’s lives are so full of mysteries that they do not
		 even know all the answers to many questions  that  have 
		 arisen in their lives and even many years  after the 
		 death of those people.For example: the mystery of the 
		 death of  Adolf Hitler, 
		the German dictator Foerer who shaped  world war  second,  
		is   still  not clear   to  the world. Where  and  how 
		did Hitler  die? Second,  
		the immortal creation of  the Italian painter Leonardo 
		da Vinci is the Mona Lisa. 
		The unmistakable identity of  the woman we  see in 
		Leonardo da  Vinci’s  painting of  the Mona Lisa is 
		still unclear  to  the world.
		In this   way  there are many incident in the world 
		which have not been  resolved yet.</p>
        <p>In addition,  it  is plainly  true  that, we  all
		like to arrange.   Our dreams from our childhood. 
		According to the normality  of life. And  we all  work
		according to that.
		For  example:  in  the institution where  we study in
		childhood. We  dream while studying that in our youth.
		We  finish  our studies  in the institution  of our dreams.
		To  be involved  in the dream  profession and  become
		something big.For instance:  in childhood. Someone dreams
		of  becoming a    doctor, someone dreams of  becoming  
		an  engineer.Besides,  someone dreams of  becoming   a 
		big  businessman  or  a  lawyer.  Again many things.</p>
		<h2>Do Forgive, But Never Forget</h2>
		<p>Forgive it is a  great word.  Likewise, our Creator 
		always like it.  And  not  only    Creator  but also  
		all  human being. As a human being we lead social life.
		In addition, 
		for this  reason, in our daily life  everyone deal many
		things with many man  about  their multipurpose  subject.</p>
		<p>And in this case,  they  have  to  deal  with some 
		people because of  misunderstandings  or  because there
		is  no  way   to  get  our  own  legal  rights. 
		And  because  of  this,  we  have  to  face  different
		kinds of  adverse  situations. 
		In consequence   of  which our  enmity with  someone  
		is  again  friendship    with  someone.</p>
		<p>Moreover,  in  the  course  of  time.  Friendship  
		comes  from enmity  with someone.  
		 But  as  intelligent  and  conscientious people. 
		 We  should  not  forget any  feelings.  Besides, if 
		 we  forget.Then  can learn  nothing  from it.  
		 On the other hand,  our  Creator   tells us to 
		 humbly  ask  others  and  the Creator  for  our  
		 wrongdoing.
		 And  then, if  we  do  wrong  to  someone, we  will
		 humbly pray  to Him for  our wrongdoing.  Moreover,
		 we  will  repent  to  the  Creator   so   that such 
		 an  unjust  act  by  us  will  never happen again.</p>
		  <h2>What  We  as  Human Beings  Should  Do?</h2>
		 <p>In another words, as the  best living  beings in  
		 creation.  
		  We  are  always  generous, tolerant, unintentional or
		  ignorant of  the  mistakes  of  others. 
		  Furthermore,  we  have  to  believe  that  the  world 
		  is  very  beautiful.  And in order   to  live  beautifully 
		  in this  beautiful world.  
		  First  of  all we  have  to  bring a  positive   change  
		  in our   attitude.</p>
