					<h2>Inspiration is the most important key for greater 
					achievement of success</h2>
					<p>In a culture obsessed with measuring talent and ability, 
					we often overlook the important role of inspiration. 
					Inspiration awakens us to new possibilities by allowing
					us to transcend our ordinary experiences and limitations.
					Inspiration propels a person from apathy to possibility, 
					and transforms the way we perceive our own capabilities. 
					Inspiration may sometimes be overlooked because of its 
					elusive nature.
					Its history of being treated as supernatural or divine
					hasn’t helped the situation. But as recent research 
					shows, inspiration can be activated, captured, and 
					manipulated, and it has a major effect on important
					life outcomes.</p>
