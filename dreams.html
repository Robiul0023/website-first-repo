			<p>Dreams are so personal, subjective and fleeting, they might seem impossible to study directly and with scientific objectivity. But in recent decades, laboratories around the world have developed sophisticated techniques for getting into the minds of people while they are dreaming. In the process, they are learning more about why we need these strange nightly experiences and how our brains generate them. In this episode, Steven Strogatz speaks with sleep researcher Antonio Zadra of the University of Montreal about how new experimental methods have changed our understanding of dreams.</p>

					<h2>People should Keep  Role   in  Time</h2>

						<p>Most  importanly, every human life in  this  world is  like the actors   and   actresses of  drama  movies. However, the  difference is  that  the film directors of  the world  let  their   actors  read  or  tell  the  script  of  their  chosen  film/ movie or  drama   before  acting.</p>

						<p>As   a  result,  the  actors  and  actresses  of    that  movie drama  know     what   to  do  and  what  to  say in  a  scene.  Moreover,  also  what  will  be his  physical   and  mental  attitude   in   that  acting  scene and  how    long   will  be    act  in  that  scene.</p>

						<p>But  the  whole  life of  a  person  on  this  planet  called Earth   is  lke acting  in  a   drama movie. Furthermore,  those  who  are  born  here  go  from childhood to  death in  a  play called Life or  in  a  movie.  And  then,  one  by one, everyday,  every time.  In the same vein, from childhood  to  adolescene to  youth.  And  from youth  to  adulthood.  And  then old  age.</p>

						<p>In contrast, not  all  people  on this earth  reach old  age from birth. Before that,  on an occasion  or  an  excuse, The persons has  to  move away  from  the  scene  of  playing  the  name  of  the world.   And  from the scene  of   a  drama   or  movie called   life  willingly  or  unwillingly.  Because  there  is  no  way.</p>

						<p>n addition,  it  is plainly  true  that, we  all like to arrange.   Our dreams from our childhood.  According to the normality  of life. And  we all  work  according to that.

						For  example:  in  the institution where  we study in childhood. We  dream while studying that in our youth.  We  finish  our studies  in the institution  of our dreams. To  be involved  in the dream  profession and  become something big.

						For instance:  in childhood. Someone dreams  of  becoming a    doctor,  someone dreams of  becoming  an  engineer. Besides,  someone dreams of  becoming   a  big  businessman  or  a  lawyer.  Again many things.</p>
						<p>Moreover,  in  the  course  of  time.  Friendship  comes  from enmity  with someone.  But  as  intelligent  and  conscientious people.  We  should  not  forget any  feelings.  Besides, if  we  forget.  Then  can learn  nothing  from it.  On the other hand,  our  Creator   tells us to  humbly  ask  others  and  the Creator  for  our  wrongdoing.</p>
						<p><p>And  then, if  we  do  wrong  to  someone, we  will humbly pray  to Him for  our wrongdoing.  Moreover,  we  will  repent  to  the  Creator   so   that such    an  unjust  act  by  us  will  never happen again</p>

						<h2>Dreams will perfect through the practise</h2>

						<p>On  the other hand,  if  we  think of  this world   as   acting .  Then every women and man in this world is an  actress.  And  these people are  being invisible  controllers.  Their creator.  Moreover, Who is the sole owner  of  all that is between  the heavens, the earth  and  the underworld.

						And  Who  has  no  partner, no rival. Likewise,  His  invisible infinite power controls  every living  thing  on earth,  includin, including man, and  the  universe.

						Similarly,  the owner  of  that   infinite   power  has  given as  much  humality  to every  creature.  Consequently, every living thing  in  the  living world does  just  that willingly  or  unwillingly.</p>
						<p>In another words, as the  best living  beings in  creation.  We  are  always  generous, tolerant, unintentional or  ignorant of  the  mistakes  of  others.  Furthermore,  we  have  to  believe  that  the  world  is  very  beautiful.  And in order   to  live  beautifully in this  beautiful world.  First  of  all we  have  to  bring a  positive   change  in our   attitude.</p>
						<p> Besides, who  are  religious  they  have to  believe  that when the servant   expresses  gratitude to  the Creator after  enjoying  the  blessing given  by  the Creator. Then  the  Creator is  very  happy with  such a  servant.</p>

								<p>In  the  same  way,  if   another person expresses gratitude  to  one person for  the  benefit  of  another.  Then not  only  the person is  happy,  but  also the Creator.   And  the grateful   person  are  satisfied.
								secondly, we  have  to  be  kind,  be generous.  And  be  tolerant   of  others.</p>
